# Insight Data Engineering Coding Challenge
## Donation Analysis

#### 1. Solution Summary
In order to make the program scalable for large amount data, in this solution, the program reads the input file line by line. In order to keep a track of repeat donors, I kept 2 hash tables in memory. One of them stores donor's **unique ID** and the **year**. Another one stores specific **recipient** received donations from a **zipcode** area for a specific **year**. The output file is generated by summarize data in the hash tables.

#### 2. Dependencies
The program needs common packages sys, re, math under Python3 for running.

#### 3. Run Instructions/Users/vickie/Desktop/README.md
Please evaluate my code by running the script file run.sh.

You can also directly run in terminal with the command below.

```
python3 ./src/donation_analytics.py ./input/itcont.txt ./input/percentile.txt ./output/repeat_donors.txt
```
